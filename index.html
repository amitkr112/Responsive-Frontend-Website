                Introduction to Education
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag">
                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
                learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any
                experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
                educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions,
                education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular
                for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal
                4, which promotes quality education for all.

                History of Eductaion
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag">
                Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
                Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to
                extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
                developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476

                The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl
                called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of
                strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed
                that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians
                cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.[8] There
                was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."[7] These concepts
                underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next
                generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual
                development and his integration into the community.
